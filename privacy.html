    <h1>Privacy Policy for Google Authentication Hub</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how this application collects, uses, and handles your information when you use it to obtain Google API tokens.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>When you authenticate using your Google Account, we request access to the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Profile Information:</strong> Your name, email address, and profile picture. This is used solely to display your logged-in status on the application page.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Drive Permission:</strong> We request permission to access your Google Drive. This permission is necessary for the generated API tokens to function correctly with the Google Drive API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This application also generates and receives <strong>Access Tokens</strong> and <strong>Refresh Tokens</strong> from Google. These tokens are displayed to you on the screen for you to copy.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Use and Store Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Display Only:</strong> Your profile information is displayed back to you on the web page to confirm your identity.</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Storage (localStorage):</strong> To provide a "logged-in" experience, your Access Token and Refresh Token are temporarily stored in your web browser's <code>localStorage</code>. This data remains on your computer and is not transmitted to any server. You can clear this data at any time by clicking the "Logout" button or by clearing your browser's cache.</li>
        <li><strong>No Server Storage:</strong> We do not have a backend server. Your personal information and tokens are never sent to, or stored on, any server controlled by us. All operations happen directly between your browser and Google's servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share your personal information or API tokens with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please open an issue on the GitHub repository for this project.</p>
